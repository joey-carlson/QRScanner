QR Scanner Build Information
==========================

Version: 2.5.0
Build: 30
Date: September 15, 2025

Recent Changes
-------------

### Sophisticated OCR Confidence Tuning System (September 15, 2025)
- Added multi-factor confidence scoring system:
  - ML Kit confidence (50% weight)
  - Pattern matching accuracy (25% weight) 
  - Bounding box stability (15% weight)
  - Environmental conditions (10% weight)
- Component-specific confidence thresholds:
  - Battery components: 90% base confidence (95% for manual verification)
  - Other components: 85% base confidence (90% for manual verification)
- Three sensitivity modes: Conservative, Balanced (default), and Aggressive
- Environmental adaptation using device sensors:
  - Light sensor for optimal OCR conditions (100-1000 lux)
  - Accelerometer-based stability detection
- Real-time environmental factor analysis and motion detection
- Configurable weights and thresholds per deployment

### System UI Overlap Fixes (September 12, 2025)
- Added WindowInsetsHelper utility class to handle edge-to-edge display
- Fixed system UI overlaps in all activities:
  - MainActivity
  - KitBundleActivity  
  - CheckInActivity
  - UnifiedExportActivity
  - ExportMethodActivity
  - SettingsActivity
  - ExportActivity
- All screens now properly respect system bars (status bar, navigation bar)
- Fixed issue where content was hidden behind system UI elements
